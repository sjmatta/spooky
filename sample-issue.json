  "body": "## Expected Behavior\nThe application should remain idle when no user interaction is present.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nEvery night at exactly **midnight**, the application starts executing code blocks that aren't even in the repository. The logs show functions being called that don't exist in our codebase:\n\n```javascript\n// This function appears in logs but doesn't exist anywhere\nfunction summonTheOldOnes() {\n  console.log(\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\");\n  return 666;\n}\n```\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Deploy the application\n2. Wait until midnight (00:00:00 UTC)\n3. Check the application logs\n4. Notice mysterious function calls and memory consumption spikes\n\n## Environment\n- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (running on servers in an old data center basement)\n- **Node.js:** v18.13.0\n- **Last known working version:** Unknown (this started happening after we moved to the new office built on an ancient burial ground)\n\n## Additional Context\nThe office cleaning staff refuse to work past 11 PM now. They claim they hear \"typing sounds\" coming from the server room even when no one is there.\n\n**UPDATE:** I just checked the git blame... some of these mysterious commits are attributed to users who left the company *years* ago. Their accounts have been deactivated.\n\n**UPDATE 2:** The functions seem to be summoning something. Memory usage hits exactly 666 MB every time.",
