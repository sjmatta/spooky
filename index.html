The logs show functions being called that don't exist in our codebase:\n\n```javascript\n// This function appears in logs but doesn't exist anywhere\nfunction summonTheOldOnes() {\n  console.log(\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\");\n  return 666;\n}\n```\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Deploy the application\n2. Wait until midnight (00:00:00 UTC)\n3. Check the application logs\n4. Notice mysterious function calls and memory consumption spikes\n\n## Environment\n- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (running on servers in an old data center basement)\n- **Node.js:** v18.13.0\n- **Last known working version:** Unknown (this started happening after we moved to the new office built on an ancient burial ground)\n\n## Additional Context\nThe office cleaning staff refuse to work past 11 PM now. They claim they hear \"typing sounds\" coming from the server room even when no one is there.\n\n**UPDATE:** I just checked the git blame... some of these mysterious commits are attributed to users who left the company *years* ago. Their accounts have been deactivated.\n\n**UPDATE 2:** The functions seem to be summoning something. Memory usage hits exactly 666 MB every time.","labels":[{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","description":"Something isn't working"},{"name":"priority: critical","color":"8B0000","description":"Critical issue requiring immediate attention"},{"name":"cursed","color":"301934","description":"Supernatural phenomena detected"},{"name":"midnight-only","color":"000000","description":"Only occurs during the witching hour"}],"assignees":[{"username":"lead_exorcist","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4"}],"milestone":{"title":"Halloween Release 2024","state":"open"},"reactions":{"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":8,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":24},"comments":[{"author":{"username":"skeptical_dev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1024?v=4"},"created_at":"2024-10-31T00:05:00Z","body":"This has to be a joke, right?
